		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">Hello! As you probably know, my name is Daniel Wagner. I live in the beautiful city of Fort Myers, Florida, and I've been here all my life. I'm eighteen years old, turning 
		nineteen soon. In 2018, I graduated from Gateway Charter High School with around a 5.0 weighted GPA (I never saw my final transcripts). I am currently a student at Florida Gulf Coast University where I am majoring in Finance. On top
		of college I also hold a part-time job at Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall, where I work operations. I spend most of my free time on my computer where I either play video games, browse the internet, write, work on this website, or 
		watch YouTube. Aside from my computer time, I also enjoy hiking and spending time with my friends and family. Below, you will find a list of my interests, listed in no particular order.

	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">Computers</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">My interest in computers is a no-brainer given my love for video games. While I'm not a tech master, I know my way around computer hardware and I know a lot about the inner
		workings of the computer. Earlier this year, I built my first PC with the gracious help of my good friend Colin. Here are the specifications of my setup if anyone is interested:

		</p><br>
	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">Astronomy</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px"> Astronomy has always been one of my passions, and space has been the one interest that has stuck with my throughout my entire life. When I was a little kid, I always
		wanted to be an astronomer when I grew up. The universe is so unimaginably large that we are literally incapable of comprehending its size. I have high hopes for humanity's future among the stars, and I have a very strong belief
		that in the future our children, if not us, will be able to visit other planets in our solar system.</p><br>
	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">Video Games</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">Oh yes, I love video games. I started out playing Star Wars Battlefront 2 on my PS2. I must have a thousand hours racked up on that game. I also liked to play Spiderman
		on my PS2, and I also enjoyed playing Lego Star Wars and Viva Pinata on the XBOX 360. When I was around eight years old, I played a game called Warhawk on the PS3, man did that game piss me off. Warhawk was where I met some of my first 
		online friends though, none of which I still talk to today unfortunately. Around this time, I also played a lot of Call of Duty: World at War, and I also got into Modern Warfare 2. I met some more online friends there, again none
		that I still keep in contact with today. 
		<br>The one game that I would say defined my childhood was LittleBigPlanet. I played LittleBigPlanet, and its sequel, for years. I mean for about 3-4 years. Some of my best childhood memories 
		are playing that game. In addition, I met so many people on LittleBigPlanet, two of which have become some of my closest friends. My two oldest online friendships were formed on LittleBigPlanet, and I have known my friends Jeremiah
		and Evan for around 7-8 years now. We still talk and play video games on the regular, however now we have moved to PC.<br>
		It was when I was around ten or so years old when my father got me into World of Warcraft, which I played a lot for about two years, and on and off up until about a year and a half ago. World of Warcraft really encaptured me
		within its world: I loved to explore, quest, level up, make money, etc. I have so much nostalgia from WoW, unfortunately it isn't the game it used to be today.<br>
		At around the time I stopped playing WoW, I was introduced to Minecraft by my friend whom I mentioned earlier, Colin. I played Minecraft on PC religiously for around 3 straight years. I started out on a group of servers called
		CityCraft, where I became very active in the community. Later on, I played on another server named DarkHelmet MC, and afterwards I started my own server, hosted right from my laptop. During the year or so of my addiction to
		Minecraft, I played on a server called Shotbow.<br>
		After playing Minecraft for so long, I started to move onto other games on PC. Throughout highschool, I played a lot of CS:GO, League of Legends, Planetside 2, and Civilization 5. In addition to these games, games I've played 
		a lot of over the past year and a half include Rust, Overwatch, and Star Wars: Empire at War.
		</p><br>
	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">Meteorology, Specifically Tropical Storm Tracking</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">In 2016-2017 I became increasingly interested in tracking tropical activity in the Atlantic. Being a resident of a Florida, a hurricane prone region, I thought it would be
		good to be in the know about the tropics. I started reading a weather blog known as Category 6, and I frequented the comments of the blog posts where other readers would discuss tropical disturbances, meteorology, and atmospheric
		science. Eventually, I learned a lot about how tropical systems form and develop, and I picked up terminology used in the field. During the hurricane season, I check forecast models, satellite imagery, and the blog almost every day.
		</p><br>
	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">Economics & Finance</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">I am currently majoring in finance not only because it is a field in which one can work in as a career but also because a life skill that I feel many people do not know much
		about. Economics is also a topic that I take great interest in, and though it is not my biggest passion, I still enjoy learning about how the markets work.</p><br>
	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">Star Wars</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">Anyone who knows me well knows that I absolutely love Star Wars. I am a HUGE Star Wars nerd, I use to read Wookiepedia for fun and as a result I know tons of the Star Wars lore,
		mostly Legends content for those of you who know what I'm talking about. I also enjoy playing Star Wars videogames, including Battlefront 2 (the old one) and Empire at War.</p><br>
	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">Writing</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">I like to write, and I spend part of my free time doing so. I am a very creative person so I will get stories that emerge in my head when I daydream, and I sometimes will write
		on them and expand on them. I also often feel stories when I listen to certain music, and will need to write these down too just to get them out of my head. Much of my recent writing focuses on dialog and character interaction rather
		than narration, and I am by no means a professional writer.</p><br>
	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">Music</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">I am a big music aficionado. I don't know how to play any instruments, however I listen to tons of different genres of music and I have a great appreciation for it. I
		also enjoy listening to OSTs from movies. Some artists that I enjoy listening to the most include:
		<li>Two Steps From Hell</li>
		<li>Lana Del Rey</li>
		<li>Howlin' Wolf</li>
		<li>ODESZA</li>
		<li>J. Cole</li>
		<li>John Williams</li>
		</p><br>
	<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; margin:5px">The Great Outdoors</h3>
		<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:black; margin:5px">I really enjoy being around nature and being outdoors. I love to explore as well. Unfortunately, in Fort Myers, most of the landscape is suburban which means there is not a lot
		to do outside that interests me. I like going for hikes at a local preserve, and I hope to go camping sometime in the near future. Later on in life, I would like to hike the Appalachian Trail with some of my closest friends. Also,
		anyone who knows me knows that one of my dreams is to buy some land up north in the wilderness, build a cabin, and just live off the land.
